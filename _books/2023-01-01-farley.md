> Surprises, misunderstandings, and mistakes are normal in software development because it is an exercise in
> exploration and discover, so we need to  focus on learning to protect ourselves from the missteps that we wil
> inevitably make along the way. (Farley 2022, 47)

> Errors introduced in coding or design were often not discovered until after the development team had rolled off the
> project and handed maintenance on to some production support team. Extreme Programming (XP) and its application of
> TDD and CI spun this on its head, placing testing front and center in the development process. This reduced the
> feedback loop to seconds, giving almost instant feedback on mistakes that, in turn, could, when done well,
> eliminate whole classes of bugs that, in the absence of TDD, often made it into production. (Farley 2022, 64)

> Continuous delivery is a high-performance, feedback-driven approach to development. One of its cornerstones is the 
> idea that we should produce software that is always ready for release into production. This is a high standard and
> demands a very high frequency and quality of feedback. (Farley 2022, 65)

> The independence of microservices is a significant benefit, but also a significant complication. Microservices are,
> by definition, independently deployable units of code. That means that we don't get to test them together
>. (Farley 2022, 66)

> One of the defining characteristics of high-performing teams in software development is their ability to make 
> progress and to change their minds, without asking for permission from any person or group outside of their small
> team. (Farley 2022, 74)

> Striving to be able to work incrementally then is also striving for higher-quality systems. If your code is hard
> to change, it is low quality, whatever it does. (Farley 2022, 79)

> Being sceptical and checking our ideas is work, but it is the only way to make real progress rather than proceeding
> on guesswork, supposition, and hubris. (Farley 2022, 88)

> Working so that our software is always in a releasable state, the idea at the heart of CD is an idea that maximizes
> the feedback that we can get on the quality of our work and one that strongly encourages us to work in smaller steps.
> This, in turn, means that we are pretty much forced to work iteratively and incrementally. (Farley 2022, 97)

> Whatever the time pressure, writing bad code is never a time-saver! (Farley 2022, 106)

> The code in a module is short enough to be readily understood as a stand-alone thing, outside the context of other
> parts of the system, even if it needs other parts of the system to be in place to do useful work. (Farley 2022,106)

> Being "idiomatic in language X" is less valuable and less important than high-quality in design. Knowing the abtruse
> details of "API Y" does not make you a better software developer; you can always look up the answer to that kind
> of question! (Farley 2022, 108)

> If our tests are difficult to write, it means that our design is poor. We get a signal, immediately. (Farley 2022, 109)

> For any given test or evaluation, I should expect, given the same version of the software under test, to see the same
> results every time I run it, however many times I run it, and whatever else is going on when I run it.
> (Farley 2022, 112)

> The real root cause of a lack of determinism in computer systems is concurrency. (Farley 2022, 113)

> A system is not modular if the internal workings of adjacent modules are exposed. (Farley 2022, 116)

> The most scalable approach to software development is to distribute it. Reduce the coupling and dependencies between
> teams and their products to the degree that each team can, independently, create, test, and deploy their work with
> no reference to another team. (Farley 2022, 117)

> We know that just adding more people to a team does not make that team go faster. (Farley 2022, 119)

> So if we want our organizations to be able to scale up, the secret is to build teams and systems that need to
> coordinate to the minimum possible degree, we need to decouple them. Working hard to maintain this organizational
> modularity is important and one of the real hallmarks of genuinely high-performing, scalable organizations.
> (Farley 2022, 119)
