> A deployment pipeline is, in essence, an automated implementation of your application's build, deploy, test,
> and release process. (Humble & Farley 2011, 3)

> There should be two tasks for a human being to perform to deploy software into a development, test, or
> production environment: to pick the version and environment and to press the "deploy" button.
> (Humble & Farley 2011, 5-6)

> A production environment should be completely locked down. It should not be possible for *anybody* to
> make a change to it without going through your organization's change management process. 
> (Humble & Farley 2011, 53)

> Unit test should not involve calling the database, using the filesystem, talking to external systems, or,
> in general, interaction between components of a system. (Humble & Farley 2011, 89)

> Software development is a naturally iterative process that thrives on the establishment of effective
> feedback loops, and we deceive ourselves if we perceive it any other way. (Humble & Farley 2011, 89)

> ... a deployment pipeline is an automated manifestation of your process for getting software from 
> version control into the hands of your users. (Humble & Farley 2011, 106)

> The binaries that get deployed into production should be exactly the same as those that went through
> the acceptance test process ... (Humble & Farley 2011, 114)

> Ultimately, you should only need to specify the target environment and the version of the application
> to initiate a successful deployment. (Humble & Farley 2011, 116)

> With automated deployment and release, the process of delivery becomes democratized. (Humble & Farley 2011, 130)

> It should be possible to deploy a single change to production through the deployment pipeline with the
> minimum possible time and ceremony. (Humble & Farley 2011, 131)

> Acceptance tests fall into two types: functional and nonfunctional. (Humble & Farley 2011, 136)

> Your deployment process should always leave the target environment in the same (correct)
> state, regardless of the state it finds it in when starting a deployment. (Humble & Farley 2011, 155)
