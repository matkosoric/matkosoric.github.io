> A deployment pipeline is, in essence, an automated implementation of your application's build, deploy, test,
> and release process. (Hummble & Farley 2011, 3)

> There should be two tasks for a human being to perform to deploy software into a development, test, or
> production environment: to pick the version and environment and to press the "deploy" button.
> (Hummble & Farley 2011, 5-6)

> A production environment should be completely locked down. It should not be possible for *anybody* to
> make a change to it without going through your organization's change management process. 
> (Hummble & Farley 2011, 53)

> Unit test should not involve calling the database, using the filesystem, talking to external systems, or,
> in general, interaction between components of a system. (Hummble & Farley 2011, 89)

> Software development is a naturally iterative process that thrives on the establishment of effective
> feedback loops, and we deceive ourselves if we percieve it any other way. (Hummble & Farley 2011, 89)
