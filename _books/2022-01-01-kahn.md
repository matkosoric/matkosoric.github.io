History of cryptography.

> Analyzing the frequency and contacts of letters is the most universal, most basic of cryptanalytic procedures. (Kahn 1996, 99)


> The system works like this: the person wishing to receive secret messages selects two large prime numbers, *p* and *q*, 
> which must be kept secret, and another large number *e*, which is public. The numbers *e* and *n*, which must be prime
> to one another, constitute the public key. They are published, as a telephone number in a phone directory. The person
> then calculates another number, *d*, by finding the greatest common denominator of *p-1* and *q-1*, multiplying this number
> by the product of *p-1* times *q-1*, adding 1, dividing this total by e, and taking the remainder. He keeps *d* secret. 
> Someone wanting to send a message first converts it into numerical form (as *a* = 10, *b* = 11, etc.),
> multiplies it by itself *e* times, divides the result by *n*, discards the quotient and takes the remainder as the cryptogram.
> When the recipient gets this, he multiplies it by itself *d* times, divides it by *n*, and takes the remainder as 
> the numerical plaintext. The system resists to the degree that *n* is hard to factor into *p* and *q*. (Kahn 1996, 982)
