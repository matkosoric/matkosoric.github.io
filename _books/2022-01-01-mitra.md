> Coding is one of the most expensive activities any software engineering team can undertake.
> Recoding a functionality that was initially designed based on wrong assumptions is a horrible,
> time-consuming, and expensive task. (Mitra & Nadareishvili 2021, 53)

> Sharing data spaces is a primary killer of independent development and independent deployability,
> in monoliths. By contrast, in a microservices architecture, independent deployability is emphasized
> as a core value and consequently, data sharing is prohibited - microservices are never allowed co-own
> responsibility for a data space in a database. It should be very clear which microservice owns any
> dataset in the database, or as we commonly state the principle: microservices must own (embed)
> their data. (Mitra & Nadareishvili 2021, 77)

> Data lakes are read-only, query-able data sinks. (Mitra & Nadareishvili 2021, 81)

> Using automation and DevOps techniques to build our services improves the predictability,
> quality, and speed of our microservices deployment. (Mitra & Nadareishvili 2021, 241)

> ArgoCD is a GitOps deployment tool, designed to use a Git repository as the source for the
> desired deployment state for our workloads and services. When it checks a repository that
> we've specified, it determines whether the target state we defined matches the running state
> in the environment. If it doesn't, ArgoCD can "synchronize" the deployment to match what
> we declared in our Helm charts (Mitra & Nadareishvili 2021, 255)

> A classic problem in software development is overengineering and premature optimization.
> This happens when we design software or architecture to resolve a problem that hardly ever occurs.
> Or when our solution to a predicted problem is more costly than the problem itself will
> ever be. (Mitra & Nadareishvili 2021, 264)

> Writing IaC requires a bit more up-front effort, but the payoff when it comes to changes
> makes it a worthwhile investment. (Mitra & Nadareishvili 2021, 270)

> A complicated system can be very sophisticated and hard to understand, but in its essence is
> predictable and based on a finite number of well-defined rules. In contrast, a complex system
> is by essence nondeterministic, composed of many components that interact at a high degree of
> freedom, and can consequently produce emergent behaviors. (Mitra & Nadareishvili 2021, 284)
