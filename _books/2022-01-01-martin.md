Coding best practices with examples in Java.

> The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions.
> It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used. 
> If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent. (Martin 2009, 18)

> Inaccurate comments are far worse than no comments at all. (Martin 2009, 54)

> If you have tests, you do not fear making changes to the code.
> Without tests every change is a possible bug. (Martin 2009, 124)

> Duplication is the primary enemy of a well-designed system. (Martin 2009, 173)

> Well-defined modules have very small interfaces that allow you to do a lot with a little. (Martin 2009, 291)

> A slow test is a test that won't get run. (Marting 2009, 314)
