> The report discusses the successes of reinforcement learning (RL, 
> which can be applied both to DL and other paradigms); graphical and Bayes models, especially 
> with probabilistic programming languages; generative models that may allow training with much 
> smaller data sets; and other kinds of probabilistic models such as those that have shown 
> remarkable successes in question answering (e.g., IBMâ€™s Watson), machine translation, and 
> robotics. While DL will certainly affect all of these fields, it is not the only or final answer. 
> More likely, DL will become an essential building block in more complicated, hybrid AI 
> architectures.
