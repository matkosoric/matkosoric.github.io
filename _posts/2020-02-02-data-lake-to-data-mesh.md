Zhamak Dehghani on data mesh.

> I personally don't envy the life of a data platform engineer. They need to consume data from teams who have no
> incentive in providing meaningful, truthful and correct data. They have very little understanding of the source
> domains that generate the data and lack the domain expertise in their teams. They need to provide data for a
> diverse set of needs, operational or analytical, without a clear understanding of the application of the data
> and access to the consuming domain's experts.

> No one will use a product that they can't trust.

> There is a long list of capabilities that a self-serve data infrastructure as a platform provides to its users, a domain's data engineers. Here are a few of them:
> * Scalable polyglot big data storage> * 
> * Encryption for data at rest and in motion
> * Data product versioning 
> * Data product schema 
> * Data product de-identification 
> * Unified data access control and logging 
> * Data pipeline implementation and orchestration 
> * Data product discovery, catalog registration and publishing 
> * Data governance and standardization 
> * Data product lineage 
> * Data product monitoring/alerting/log 
> * Data product quality metrics (collection and sharing)
> * In memory data caching 
> * Federated identity management 
> * Compute and data locality
