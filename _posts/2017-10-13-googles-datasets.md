> The current catalog indexes over 26 billion datasets even though it includes only those datasets whose 
> access permissions make them readable by all Google engineers.

> We enable dataset owners to provide text descriptions of their datasets. These descriptions are critical to our
> ranking, and also help us filter out datasets that are experimental or that we should not show to the users

> The Goods dashboard is a configurable one-stop shop for displaying all the datasets generated by a team along with 
> interesting metadata per dataset, such as various health metrics, other dashboards, and whether or not the
> storage system in which the dataset resides is online. Goods updates the content of a dashboard automatically as it
> updates the metadata of the datasets in the dashboard. Users can easily embed the dashboard page within other 
> documents and share the dashboard with others.
