> Many cyber operations are governed by a simple  fact: In order to develop a cyber capability with a potent or
customized effect on a target network, substantial reconnaissance and preparation are required from within that
targeted network.
(Buchanan & Cunningham 2020, 58)

> For example, one could imagine a basic scenario in which an adversary is launching a cyber operation against 
American targets, and the United States conducts a basic cyber attack to interfere with the adversary’s internet 
connectivity and inhibit the adversary’s action.
(Buchanan & Cunningham 2020, 68-69)
