> A key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) is a set of algorithms that, under certain conditions, can be
used by two parties to establish a shared secret key over a public channel. A shared secret key that
is securely established using a KEM can then be used with symmetric-key cryptographic algorithms
to perform basic tasks in secure communications, such as encryption and authentication. This
standard specifies a key-encapsulation mechanism called ML-KEM. The security of ML-KEM is
related to the computational difficulty of the Module Learning with Errors problem. At present,
ML-KEM is believed to be secure, even against adversaries who possess a quantum computer.
This standard specifies three parameter sets for ML-KEM. In order of increasing security strength
and decreasing performance, these are ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, and ML-KEM-1024.
