Article by Jeff Atwood on Pair programming and code reviews with conclusion:

> In the end, I don't think it's a matter of picking one over the other so much as ensuring you have more than one
> pair of eyes looking at the code you've written, however you choose to do it. When your code is reviewed by
> another human being -- whether that person is sitting right next to you, or thousands of miles away --
> you will produce better software. That I can guarantee.
