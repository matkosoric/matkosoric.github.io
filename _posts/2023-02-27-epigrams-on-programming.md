120 aphorisms on programming, written in 1982 and with many of them still surprisingly valid, some of which are:

> 8. A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant.

> 31. Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it.

> 57. It is easier to change the specification to fit the program than vice versa.

> 74. Is it possible that software is not like anything else, that it is meant to be discarded: that the whole point is to see it as a soap bubble?

> 93. When someone says "I want a programming language in which I need only say what I wish done," give him a lollipop.

> 98. In computing, the mean time to failure keeps getting shorter.

> 104. The proof of a system's value is its existence.

> 105. You can't communicate complexity, only an awareness of it.
