Pretty good definition of continuous delivery:

> Continuous Delivery is the ability to get changes of all types—including new features, configuration changes, 
> bug fixes and experiments—into production, or into the hands of users, safely and quickly in a sustainable way.

> Our goal is to make deployments—whether of a large-scale distributed system, a complex production environment, an 
> embedded system, or an app—predictable, routine affairs that can be performed on demand.

> We achieve all this by ensuring our code is always in a deployable state, even in the face of teams of thousands of 
> developers making changes on a daily basis. We thus completely eliminate the integration, testing and hardening 
> phases that traditionally followed “dev complete”, as well as code freezes.
