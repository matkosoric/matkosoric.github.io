Paper about robustness and fragility of software systems by Steven Gribble: 

> ...we believe that any system that attempts to gain robustness solely through precognition is prone to fragility.

> ...precognition: attempting to gain knowledge of something in advance of its actual occurrence.

> Complex systems must expect failure and plan for it accordingly.

> This fragility arises because the diffuse coupling of components within a complex systems makes them prone to
> completely unpredictable behavior in the face of small perturbations. Instead, we argue that a different design
> paradigm needs to emerge if we want to prevent the ever-increasing complexity of our systems from causing
> them to become more and more unstable. This different design paradigm is one in which systems are given the best 
> possible chance of stable behavior (through techniques such as overprovisioning, admission control, 
> and introspection), as well as the ability to adapt to unexpected situations (by treating introspection as 
> feedback to a closed control loop).
