Meir Lehman on maintainability and software development lifecycle.

> Thus the question raised by the high cost of maintenance is not exclusively how to control and reduce that cost by
> avoiding errors or by detecting them earlier in the development and usage cycle. The unit cost of change must
> initially be made as low as possible and its growth, as the system ages, minimized. Programs must be made more
> alterable, and the alterability maintained throughout their lifetime. The change process itself must be planned
> and controlled. Assessments of the economic viability of a program must include total lifetime costs and their life 
> cycle distribution, and not be based exclusively on the initial development costs. (Lehman 1980, 1061)

> Managerial strategy will inevitably be dominated by a desire to achieve maxi-mum local payoff with visible short-term
> benefit. It will not often take into account long-term penalties, that cannot be precisely predicted and whose
> cost cannot be assessed. (Lehman 1980, 1065-1066)
