Paper about resume driven development and its impacts on projects.

> Resume-Driven Development (RDD) is an interaction between human resource and software professionals in the
> software development recruiting process. It is characterized by overemphasizing numerous trending or 
> hyped technologies in both job advertisements and CVs, although experience with these technologies is actually 
> perceived as less valuable on both sides. RDD has the potential to develop a self-sustaining dynamic.

> Potential consequences of RDD are mainly decreased software quality and
> increased employee turnover due to false expectations on both sides
