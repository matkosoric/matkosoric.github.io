> This report describes NISTâ€™s expected approach to transitioning from quantum-vulnerable
cryptographic algorithms to post-quantum digital signature algorithms and key-establishment
schemes. It identifies existing quantum-vulnerable cryptographic standards and the quantum-resistant 
standards to which information technology products and services will need to
transition. It is intended to foster engagement with industry, standards organizations, and
relevant agencies to facilitate and accelerate the adoption of post-quantum cryptography.
