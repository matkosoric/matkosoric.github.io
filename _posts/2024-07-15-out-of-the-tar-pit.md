Ben Moseley and Peter Marks on complexity.

> Simplicity is Hard. (Moseley and Marks 2006, 3)

> Hence we define the following two types of complexity:
> Essential Complexity is inherent in, and the essence of, the problem (as seen by the users).
> Accidental Complexity is all the rest — complexity with which the development team would not have to deal in the
> ideal world (e.g. complexity arising from performance issues and from suboptimal language and infrastructure).
> (Moseley and Marks 2006, 21)

> The relational model [Cod70] has — despite its origins — nothing intrinsically to do with databases. Rather it is 
> an elegant approach to structuring data, a means for manipulating such data, and a mechanism for maintaining 
> integrity and consistency of state. These features are applicable to state and data in any context. 
> (Moseley and Marks 2006, 37)

> We have argued that complexity causes more problems in large software systems than anything else. We have also 
> argued that it can be tamed — but only through a concerted effort to avoid it where possible, and to separate 
> it where not. (Moseley and Marks 2006, 64)
