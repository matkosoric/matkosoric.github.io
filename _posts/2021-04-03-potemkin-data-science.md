Blog post by Michael Correll:

> Data science in an organization can have this flavor of a marketing tool.

> The data scientist exists to provide convincing post hoc support for decisions or strategies that have already been made prior to or in absence of data.

> Both action and inaction could be pitched in a way that sounds “smart” and “data-driven.”
